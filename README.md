# Assassin's Creed Quiz App

I have developed this app for a class assignment to undestand the aspects of GitHub and practice making commits on projects and pushing the changes to GitHub. Another purpose for this project was to practice JavaScript Object Oriented Programming.

I designed the quiz app with a simple UI and used a switch statement for the end to detiremine the message displayed the user based on how many answers where answered correctly.
